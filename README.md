TOPAS-nBio is an extension of TOPAS (TOol for PArticle Simulations), which can be obtained from www.topasmc.org. The TOPAS documentation can be found at https://topas.readthedocs.io/. 

The TOPAS-nBio package was described in Schuemann et al., Radiation Research, 2019, 191(2), p.125. This reference should be cited for all work using the TOPAS-nBio package.

We encourage contribution of user-developed extensions that fit within the TOPAS-nBio scheme. If you would like to contribute code, please contact the developers.
